## 🌐 My Personal CV (HTML/CSS)

This is a sample HTML/CSS-based CV page I designed. Below is the source code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <title>Sinan's CV</title>
 
  <footer>
    &copy; 2025 Sinan | Designed with 💻
  </footer>
</body>
</html>



---

### What to do next:

- Save your full CV HTML as a file called `index.html` (or any name) in your repo or host it on your personal domain.
- Keep the above `README.md` content in your repo’s root.
- When people visit your repo on GitHub, they get a nice intro and can click to see your full CV online.

If you want, I can also help prepare the full standalone `index.html` CV file for you to put in your repo or site. Just let me know!
